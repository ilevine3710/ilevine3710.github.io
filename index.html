                Early Life:
            </h3>
            <div class="text">
                I grew up on the rough streets of Newark. My father worked a lot in the family business, so my Uncle Jun taught me right from wrong.
                Don't ask me about my mother. I respect her, so that's why I put her in that retirement community!

            <h3>
                Working in Waste Management:
            </h3>
            <div class="text">
                My official title is Waste Management Consultant. I make a good living and provide for my family.
                The business isn't what it used to be, with the government inferrin'. Just because we are Italian 
                doesn't mean we are involved in anything "criminal".
    
            </div>
            <h3>
                Life at Lehigh:
            </h3>
            <div class="text">
                After my brief stint at Seton Hall for a semester and a half, I felt that I needed some
                perspective on my education. I just hope Lehigh has a vibrant and passionate Italian community.
